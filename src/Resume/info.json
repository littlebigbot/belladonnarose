These days I have developed a passion for building beautiful, functional, and accessible web applications, especially with WebRTC.\n          Check out the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/littlebigbot/belladonnarose\">repo</a> for this site to see a sample of my work."
